# Symfony Docker

A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-based installer and runtime for the [Symfony](https://symfony.com) web framework,
with [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev) and [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) inside!

![CI](https://github.com/dunglas/symfony-docker/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Getting Started
Please open a terminal window that points to the root of this project folder

1. If not already done, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.10+)
2. Run `docker compose build --no-cache` to build fresh images
3. Run `docker compose up --pull always -d --wait` to set up and start a fresh Symfony project
4. Open `https://localhost` in your favorite web browser and [accept the auto-generated TLS certificate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1352334)
5. Follow the step [here](docs/tls.md) to run a command for your Mac or Windows or Linux to add the certificate to your trusted root store of your machine.
6. Run `docker compose down --remove-orphans` to stop the Docker containers.

## Database migrations and fixtures
Please open a terminal window that points to the root of this project folder

1. Run `docker compose exec php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate` to run the migration scripts located [in](migrations).
2. Run `docker compose exec php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load` to populate the database tables with data.

## After Getting started - after you already build docker images and pulled them initially.
You are returning back to the project and stopped the docker container's and now maybe want to start the project back up.
Please open a terminal window that points to the root of this project folder

1. Run `docker compose up -d --wait` to start the existing project back up
2. Open `https://localhost` to view the application
3. Run `docker compose down --remove-orphans` to stop the Docker containers.
